# Git workshop

## Notes
- Make sure to use .gitignore
    - password files
    - bin files
    - keys

### Branches
- Never commit to master branch
- Commit messages
    - Use descriptive commit messages
- Github pages feature is amazing
    - This is the ability to just publish static pages straight on github
- You can edit the come of the website, BUT TI'S A BAD IDEA
- Staging is for selecting which files you want to be in the commit
    - Useful when you changed a bunch of files so you can commit them separately
